Personal finance is about meeting your financial goals and understanding all the routes to do this, from saving and investing, and keeping debt under control, to buying a home to planning for retirement—and coming up with a plan to accomplish these goals.It’s also the name of the industry that provides financial products to meet these goals.
Why is personal finance important?
Not getting control of your personal finances can leave you unprotected when a crisis comes along–whether it’s an illness, an unexpected job loss, or the death of the family breadwinner. The pandemic that began in March 2020 showed all of these issues in sharp relief and showed the importance of planning for emergencies.
How do I wire money to someone?
If you need to move large amounts of money, a wire transfer–either bank to bank or via an agent such as Western Union–is the safest way to go. Expect to pay a fee and review the fine print before you agree to the transfer. It may take a few hours or days, depending on the details. Note that a wire transfer is different from an Automated Clearing House (ACH) transfer.						</div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What is Lorem Ipsum?<br />
Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry&#8217;s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
<p>Why do we use it?<br />
It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using &#8216;Content here, content here&#8217;, making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for &#8216;lorem ipsum&#8217; will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Fashion</b> is a form of <a title="Self-expression values" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-expression_values">self-expression</a> and autonomy at a particular period and place and in a specific context, of <a title="Clothing" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clothing">clothing</a>, <a title="Footwear" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Footwear">footwear</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" title="Lifestyle (sociology)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)">lifestyle</a>, <a title="Fashion accessory" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion_accessory">accessories</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" title="Makeup" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makeup">makeup</a>, <a title="Hairstyle" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hairstyle">hairstyle</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" title="Body posture" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_posture">body posture</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-:9_1-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion#cite_note-:9-1">[1]</a></sup> The term implies a look defined by the fashion industry as that which is <i>trending</i>. Everything that is considered <i>fashion</i> is available and popularized by the fashion system (industry and media).</p>
<p>Due to increased mass-production of <a title="Commodity" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity">commodities</a> and clothing at lower prices and global reach, <a title="Sustainable fashion" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_fashion">sustainability</a> has become an urgent issue among politicians, brands, and consumers.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-152 size-full" src="http://miraculousher.great-site.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/fashion.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" /></p>
<p>Fashion scholar Susan B. Kaiser states that everyone is &#8220;forced to appear&#8221;, unmediated before others.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> Everyone is evaluated by their attire, and evaluation includes the consideration of <a title="Color of clothing" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_of_clothing">colors</a>, materials, silhouette, and how garments appear on the body. Garments identical in style and material also appear different depending on the wearer&#8217;s body shape, or whether the garment has been washed, folded, mended, or is new.</p>
<p><i>Fashion</i> is defined in a number of different ways, and its application can be sometimes unclear. Though the term <i>fashion</i> connotes difference, as in &#8220;the new fashions of the season&#8221;, it can also connote sameness, for example in reference to &#8220;the fashions of the 1960s&#8221;, implying a general uniformity. Fashion can signify the latest trends, but may often reference fashions of a previous era, leading to the understanding of fashions from a different time period re-appearing. While what is fashionable can be defined by a relatively insular, esteemed and often rich aesthetic elite who make a look exclusive, such as <a class="mw-redirect" title="Fashion house" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion_house">fashion houses</a> and <a title="Haute couture" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haute_couture">haute couturiers</a>, this &#8216;look&#8217; is often designed by pulling references from <a title="Subculture" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subculture">subcultures</a> and social groups who are not considered elite, and are thus excluded from making the distinction of what is fashion themselves.</p>

These repurposed items get a second life, and clever upcyclers have new <a href="https://www.realsimple.com/work-life/life-strategies/cool-gadgets">cool gadgets,</a> gizmos, and decorations, plus new ways to solve daily problems. Old things can be found in <a href="https://www.realsimple.com/new-uses-for-old-things/new-uses-home-office">home offices,</a> kitchens, craft rooms, and more. Upcycling ideas for these things just take a little creativity.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-157 size-full" src="http://miraculousher.great-site.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/lifestyle1-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1594" srcset="http://miraculousher.great-site.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/lifestyle1-scaled.jpg 2560w, http://miraculousher.great-site.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/lifestyle1-1536x957.jpg 1536w, http://miraculousher.great-site.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/lifestyle1-2048x1275.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></p>
<p>upcycling reuses old things, sure, but it also puts standard tools such as colanders, toothbrushes, and more to work in new ways. With these new uses, every item in the home can have fresh potential, and the need to buy a brand new tool for every minor issue lessens slightly.</p>
<p>Some new uses for old things solve particular problems, like <a href="https://www.realsimple.com/home-organizing/stop-trash-can-smell">trash can smell,</a> while others use old things—think <a href="https://www.realsimple.com/home-organizing/new-uses-comb">combs</a> or <a href="https://www.realsimple.com/home-organizing/new-uses-rubber-bands">rubber bands</a>—in dynamic ways that cut down on plenty of annoying little issues. Out of hundreds of new uses for old things, the upcycling ideas for repurposing household items here are some favorites. Put them to the test around the house, and prepare to be amazed by what old things can do</p>

<h2><span id="Personal_financial_planning_process" class="mw-headline">Personal financial planning process</span></h2>
<p>The key component of personal finance is financial planning, which is a dynamic process that requires regular monitoring and re-evaluation. In general, it involves five steps:<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_finance#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_finance#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li><b>Assessment</b>: A person&#8217;s financial situation is assessed by compiling simplified versions of financial statements including <a title="Balance sheet" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_sheet">balance sheets</a> and <a title="Income statement" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_statement">income statements</a>. A personal balance sheet lists the values of personal <a title="Asset" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset">assets</a> (e.g., car, house, clothes, stocks, bank account, cryptocurrencies), along with personal <a class="mw-redirect" title="Liability (accounting)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liability_(accounting)">liabilities</a> (e.g., credit card debt, bank loan, mortgage). A personal <a title="Income statement" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_statement">income statement</a> lists personal <a title="Income" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income">income</a> and <a title="Expense" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expense">expenses</a>.</li>
<li><b>Goal setting</b>: Having multiple goals is common, including a mix of short- and long-term goals. For example, a long-term goal would be to &#8220;retire at age 65 with a personal net worth of $1,000,000,&#8221; while a short-term goal would be to &#8220;save up for a new computer in the next month.&#8221; Setting financial goals helps to direct financial planning. Goal setting is done with an objective to meet specific financial requirements.</li>
<li><b>Plan creation</b>: The financial plan details how to accomplish the goals. It could include, for example, reducing unnecessary expenses, increasing the employment income, or investing in the <a title="Stock market" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market">stock market</a>.</li>
<li><b>Execution</b>: Execution of a financial plan often requires discipline and perseverance. Many people obtain assistance from professionals such as <a title="Accountant" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountant">accountants</a>, <a title="Financial planner" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_planner">financial planners</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" title="Investment adviser" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment_adviser">investment advisers</a>, and <a title="Lawyer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer">lawyers</a>.</li>
