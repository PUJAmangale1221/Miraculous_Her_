										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Even though she’s not teaching 4<sup>th</sup> graders anymore, Lindsey, the soulful magician behind this classic food blog, has kept her desire to teach, inspire, and engage with others through her homemade recipes. But also through sharing important and heartfelt bits of her private life, such as traveling, motherhood, family home project, etc.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-94 size-full" src="http://miraculousher.great-site.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/a-pinch-of-yum.webp" alt="" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="http://miraculousher.great-site.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/a-pinch-of-yum.webp 2000w, http://miraculousher.great-site.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/a-pinch-of-yum-1536x1024.webp 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p>Since blogging has become a source of income for her family, in 2013, Lindsey and her husband, Bjork, built a community called ‘Food Blogger Pro’ – “<em>a place to teach people everything we’ve learned over the last 7-8 years in this industry</em>”.</p>
<p>Now <em>A Pinch of Yum</em> is not just Lindsey but a whole team working on developing recipes, video production, and media scheduling, just to mention a few. If you’re not here “on business”, trying to get a better glimpse of how to develop your own income creating food blog, then you’re here for the real goodies – Lindsey’s recipes. And, <em>oh my!</em>… you’re in for a treat!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Fashion</b> is a form of <a title="Self-expression values" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-expression_values">self-expression</a> and autonomy at a particular period and place and in a specific context, of <a title="Clothing" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clothing">clothing</a>, <a title="Footwear" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Footwear">footwear</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" title="Lifestyle (sociology)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)">lifestyle</a>, <a title="Fashion accessory" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion_accessory">accessories</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" title="Makeup" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makeup">makeup</a>, <a title="Hairstyle" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hairstyle">hairstyle</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" title="Body posture" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_posture">body posture</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-:9_1-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion#cite_note-:9-1">[1]</a></sup> The term implies a look defined by the fashion industry as that which is <i>trending</i>. Everything that is considered <i>fashion</i> is available and popularized by the fashion system (industry and media).</p>
<p>Due to increased mass-production of <a title="Commodity" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity">commodities</a> and clothing at lower prices and global reach, <a title="Sustainable fashion" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_fashion">sustainability</a> has become an urgent issue among politicians, brands, and consumers.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-152 size-full" src="http://miraculousher.great-site.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/fashion.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" /></p>
<p>Fashion scholar Susan B. Kaiser states that everyone is &#8220;forced to appear&#8221;, unmediated before others.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> Everyone is evaluated by their attire, and evaluation includes the consideration of <a title="Color of clothing" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_of_clothing">colors</a>, materials, silhouette, and how garments appear on the body. Garments identical in style and material also appear different depending on the wearer&#8217;s body shape, or whether the garment has been washed, folded, mended, or is new.</p>
<p><i>Fashion</i> is defined in a number of different ways, and its application can be sometimes unclear. Though the term <i>fashion</i> connotes difference, as in &#8220;the new fashions of the season&#8221;, it can also connote sameness, for example in reference to &#8220;the fashions of the 1960s&#8221;, implying a general uniformity. Fashion can signify the latest trends, but may often reference fashions of a previous era, leading to the understanding of fashions from a different time period re-appearing. While what is fashionable can be defined by a relatively insular, esteemed and often rich aesthetic elite who make a look exclusive, such as <a class="mw-redirect" title="Fashion house" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion_house">fashion houses</a> and <a title="Haute couture" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haute_couture">haute couturiers</a>, this &#8216;look&#8217; is often designed by pulling references from <a title="Subculture" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subculture">subcultures</a> and social groups who are not considered elite, and are thus excluded from making the distinction of what is fashion themselves.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.realsimple.com/new-uses-for-old-things/new-uses-crafts">New uses</a> for old things give used-up items—think antiques, empty containers, office supplies, and more—a new purpose. These repurposed items get a second life, and clever upcyclers have new <a href="https://www.realsimple.com/work-life/life-strategies/cool-gadgets">cool gadgets,</a> gizmos, and decorations, plus new ways to solve daily problems. Old things can be found in <a href="https://www.realsimple.com/new-uses-for-old-things/new-uses-home-office">home offices,</a> kitchens, craft rooms, and more. Upcycling ideas for these things just take a little creativity.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-157 size-full" src="http://miraculousher.great-site.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/lifestyle1-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1594" srcset="http://miraculousher.great-site.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/lifestyle1-scaled.jpg 2560w, http://miraculousher.great-site.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/lifestyle1-1536x957.jpg 1536w, http://miraculousher.great-site.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/lifestyle1-2048x1275.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></p>
<p>upcycling reuses old things, sure, but it also puts standard tools such as colanders, toothbrushes, and more to work in new ways. With these new uses, every item in the home can have fresh potential, and the need to buy a brand new tool for every minor issue lessens slightly.</p>
<p>Some new uses for old things solve particular problems, like <a href="https://www.realsimple.com/home-organizing/stop-trash-can-smell">trash can smell,</a> while others use old things—think <a href="https://www.realsimple.com/home-organizing/new-uses-comb">combs</a> or <a href="https://www.realsimple.com/home-organizing/new-uses-rubber-bands">rubber bands</a>—in dynamic ways that cut down on plenty of annoying little issues. Out of hundreds of new uses for old things, the upcycling ideas for repurposing household items here are some favorites. Put them to the test around the house, and prepare to be amazed by what old things can do</p>
