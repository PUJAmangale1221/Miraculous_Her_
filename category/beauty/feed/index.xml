										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Even though she’s not teaching 4<sup>th</sup> graders anymore, Lindsey, the soulful magician behind this classic food blog, has kept her desire to teach, inspire, and engage with others through her homemade recipes. But also through sharing important and heartfelt bits of her private life, such as traveling, motherhood, family home project, etc.</p>

<p>Since blogging has become a source of income for her family, in 2013, Lindsey and her husband, Bjork, built a community called ‘Food Blogger Pro’ – “<em>a place to teach people everything we’ve learned over the last 7-8 years in this industry</em>”.</p>
<p>Now <em>A Pinch of Yum</em> is not just Lindsey but a whole team working on developing recipes, video production, and media scheduling, just to mention a few. If you’re not here “on business”, trying to get a better glimpse of how to develop your own income creating food blog, then you’re here for the real goodies – Lindsey’s recipes. And, <em>oh my!</em>… you’re in for a treat!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Beauty</b> is commonly described as a feature of objects that makes these objects pleasurable to perceive. Such objects include landscapes, sunsets, humans and works of art. Beauty, together with art and taste, is the main subject of <a title="Aesthetics" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics">aesthetics</a>, one of the major branches of philosophy. As a positive aesthetic value, it is contrasted with <a title="Unattractiveness" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unattractiveness">ugliness</a> as its negative counterpart. Along with <a title="Truth" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth">truth</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" title="Value (ethics)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(ethics)">goodness</a> it is one of the <a title="Transcendentals" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendentals">transcendentals</a>, which are often considered the three fundamental concepts of human understanding.</p>
<p>One difficulty in understanding beauty is due to the fact that it has both objective and subjective aspects: it is seen as a property of things but also as depending on the emotional response of observers. Because of its subjective side, beauty is said to be &#8220;in the eye of the beholder&#8221;.<sup id="cite_ref-phrase_2-0" class="reference"></sup> It has been argued that the ability on the side of the subject needed to perceive and judge beauty, sometimes referred to as the &#8220;sense of taste&#8221;, can be trained and that the verdicts of experts coincide in the long run. This would suggest that the standards of validity of judgments of beauty are <i>intersubjective</i>, i.e. dependent on a group of judges, rather than fully <i>subjective</i> or fully <i>objective</i>.</p>

<p>Beauty, together with art and taste, is the main subject of <a title="Aesthetics" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics">aesthetics</a>, one of the major branches of philosophy.<sup id="cite_ref-StanfordBeauty_3-0" class="reference"></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Britannica_4-0" class="reference"></sup> Beauty is usually categorized as an aesthetic property besides other properties, like grace, elegance or the <a title="Sublime (philosophy)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublime_(philosophy)">sublime</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-BeautyandUgliness_5-0" class="reference"></sup><sup id="cite_ref-BeautyinAesthetics_6-0" class="reference"></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Levinson_7-0" class="reference"></sup>As a positive aesthetic value, beauty is contrasted with <a class="mw-redirect" title="Ugliness" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ugliness">ugliness</a> as its negative counterpart. Beauty is often listed as one of the three fundamental concepts of human understanding besides <a title="Truth" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth">truth</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" title="Value (ethics)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(ethics)">goodness</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-BeautyandUgliness_5-1" class="reference"></sup><sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"></sup><sup id="cite_ref-BeautyinAesthetics_6-1" class="reference"></sup></p>
<p>Objectivists or <a title="Philosophical realism" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_realism">realists</a> see beauty as an objective or mind-independent feature of beautiful things, which is denied by <i>subjectivists</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-StanfordBeauty_3-1" class="reference"></sup><sup id="cite_ref-DeClercq2013_9-0" class="reference"></sup> The source of this debate is that judgments of beauty seem to be based on subjective grounds, namely our feelings, while claiming universal correctness at the same time.<sup id="cite_ref-Zangwill_10-0" class="reference"></sup>This tension is sometimes referred to as the &#8220;antinomy of taste&#8221;.<sup id="cite_ref-Britannica_4-1" class="reference"></sup>Adherents of both sides have suggested that a certain faculty, commonly called a <i>sense of taste</i>, is necessary for making reliable judgments about beauty.<sup id="cite_ref-StanfordBeauty_3-2" class="reference"></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Zangwill_10-1" class="reference"></sup><a title="David Hume" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hume">David Hume</a>, for example, suggests that this faculty can be trained and that the verdicts of experts coincide in the long run.<sup id="cite_ref-StanfordBeauty_3-3" class="reference"></sup><sup id="cite_ref-DeClercq2013_9-1" class="reference"></sup></p>
