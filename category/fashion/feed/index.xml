										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Fashion</b> is a form of <a title="Self-expression values" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-expression_values">self-expression</a> and autonomy at a particular period and place and in a specific context, of <a title="Clothing" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clothing">clothing</a>, <a title="Footwear" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Footwear">footwear</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" title="Lifestyle (sociology)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)">lifestyle</a>, <a title="Fashion accessory" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion_accessory">accessories</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" title="Makeup" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makeup">makeup</a>, <a title="Hairstyle" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hairstyle">hairstyle</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" title="Body posture" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_posture">body posture</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-:9_1-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion#cite_note-:9-1">[1]</a></sup> The term implies a look defined by the fashion industry as that which is <i>trending</i>. Everything that is considered <i>fashion</i> is available and popularized by the fashion system (industry and media).</p>
<p>Due to increased mass-production of <a title="Commodity" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity">commodities</a> and clothing at lower prices and global reach, <a title="Sustainable fashion" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_fashion">sustainability</a> has become an urgent issue among politicians, brands, and consumers.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-152 size-full" src="http://miraculousher.great-site.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/fashion.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" /></p>
<p>Fashion scholar Susan B. Kaiser states that everyone is &#8220;forced to appear&#8221;, unmediated before others.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> Everyone is evaluated by their attire, and evaluation includes the consideration of <a title="Color of clothing" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_of_clothing">colors</a>, materials, silhouette, and how garments appear on the body. Garments identical in style and material also appear different depending on the wearer&#8217;s body shape, or whether the garment has been washed, folded, mended, or is new.</p>
<p><i>Fashion</i> is defined in a number of different ways, and its application can be sometimes unclear. Though the term <i>fashion</i> connotes difference, as in &#8220;the new fashions of the season&#8221;, it can also connote sameness, for example in reference to &#8220;the fashions of the 1960s&#8221;, implying a general uniformity. Fashion can signify the latest trends, but may often reference fashions of a previous era, leading to the understanding of fashions from a different time period re-appearing. While what is fashionable can be defined by a relatively insular, esteemed and often rich aesthetic elite who make a look exclusive, such as <a class="mw-redirect" title="Fashion house" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion_house">fashion houses</a> and <a title="Haute couture" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haute_couture">haute couturiers</a>, this &#8216;look&#8217; is often designed by pulling references from <a title="Subculture" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subculture">subcultures</a> and social groups who are not considered elite, and are thus excluded from making the distinction of what is fashion themselves.</p>
