Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry&#8217;s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

Why do we use it?
It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using &#8216;Content here, content here&#8217;, making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for &#8216;lorem ipsum&#8217; will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour						</div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Even though she’s not teaching 4<sup>th</sup> graders anymore, Lindsey, the soulful magician behind this classic food blog, has kept her desire to teach, inspire, and engage with others through her homemade recipes. But also through sharing important and heartfelt bits of her private life, such as traveling, motherhood, family home project, etc.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-94 size-full" src="http://miraculousher.great-site.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/a-pinch-of-yum.webp" alt="" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="http://miraculousher.great-site.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/a-pinch-of-yum.webp 2000w, http://miraculousher.great-site.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/a-pinch-of-yum-1536x1024.webp 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p>Since blogging has become a source of income for her family, in 2013, Lindsey and her husband, Bjork, built a community called ‘Food Blogger Pro’ – “<em>a place to teach people everything we’ve learned over the last 7-8 years in this industry</em>”.</p>
<p>Now <em>A Pinch of Yum</em> is not just Lindsey but a whole team working on developing recipes, video production, and media scheduling, just to mention a few. If you’re not here “on business”, trying to get a better glimpse of how to develop your own income creating food blog, then you’re here for the real goodies – Lindsey’s recipes. And, <em>oh my!</em>… you’re in for a treat!</p>
